# Railway-Reservation
An interactive and easy to use ticket booking program coded in C language including an effective use of C graphics. Basically this program gives the user the opportunity to input the boarding and destination station and then searches all the trains in between both stations, facilitates the user to book tickets, cancel tickets and to get their respective PNR status. 

There is also an admin panel using which trains information can be added, deleted or modified in the system and users can be added or deleted , i.e user management can be done easily.
